# 3DLNews: A Three-decade Dataset of US Local News Articles

Local news serves as a vital source of information for communities, reflecting the diverse array of events, issues, and perspectives that shape society at the grassroots level. Despite its significance, comprehensive datasets capturing the breadth and depth of local news coverage in the United States have been relatively scarce. The 3DLNews dataset addresses this gap by providing a rich, extensive, and meticulously curated collection of local news articles.

### Key Features
